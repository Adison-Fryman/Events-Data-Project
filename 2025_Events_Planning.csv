This sounds very specific and sent to a specific group of people based on the email. I think FAB could attend if they are interested in attending as parents. I think this is a great space for us to be in as an organization, as well as to present resources and possibly sign up some families, as the age group of kiddos is right in our wheelhouse. From Fredericka's email: Good morning!☀️ I wanted to personally invite you to an Early Childhood family event! This event is specifically for parents, providers, and families at our community based child development centers and providers here in Grand Rapids. We want families to let us know how the envision our “ early learning community “. At this event, parents/ caregivers and providers will come together to share ideas, experiences, and bring forward solutions to how we can create a better and more equitable ECE ecosystem! Space is limited to please encourage you/ your families to attend. We will have child care on-site and also raffle, food and gifts.

Please add any other important notes below.:
I looked at GRPL's social media posts from this event in past years and it looks like there is a decent turn out of kids and families. It looked like the most popular spots for kids were the crafting area, tabletop games area, the face painting, which according to this year's event details are all on Level 3 of the library from 12-5. I think if we could table in that area it would bring us the best traffic within our demographic. Although there isn't an dedicated area for resource tables necessarily, I think our relationship with GRPL will make it easy to arrange a spot for us.
