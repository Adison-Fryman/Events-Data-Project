This did allow more more engagement with the families and kids.,Yes,"I have a couple thoughts: Yes, I think tabling here is important and we should continue to show our faces especially since it's outside of Kent County. However, if we are going to be tabling for a story time, I think we need to come up with a better action plan for engagement. Story time is really only a half hour and I did come up to the front to do a one minute speech on Family Futures but I don't think parents were fully able to engage because with so many small kids together, they make a lot of noise and their was a lot going on. Because of this, I was hoping to talk to some parents more in-depthly after story time but it didn't work out like that. Parents seemed very eager to leave and just seemed to want to grab the coloring book, book and leave. Which is totally understandable with having little kids and trying to control them and get them out the door. Many mother's came with 2+ kids so it makes sense. Two things I would of liked to do differently if this is how story times tend to go: I would of liked to staple our flyers and information to the coloring book on the front or back so even if I am not having an in-depth conversation with parents, they are still receiving our information. Not as many parents got ahold of our information because of their kids presence. The second thing, I would of liked someone to be there with me. There is a lot going on at the end of story time and I would of liked one person to hand out coloring books, books and the other staff member really try and engage with a couple parents before they leave. Everyone came up to my table at once and I was not able to do two things at once. So the numbers for people I engaged with were estimates and it wasn't as in-depth of engagement as I would have liked. Besides this, I really loved the event itself, there was probably 17 parents and well over 25 kids. The cedar springs library is very beautiful and tends to be a popular place where families come!",I unfortunately don't have anything this time but it was really cool to watch all the kids sing and dance together for a music story time!,,Teal

I think the bubbles went well while I was there. It did seem a little messy with the pavement getting wet with the bubble mixture, but it wasn't too bad. We also had bubbles blowing.",Yes,"Overall I think it's a great event to be at, especially as we do a lot of events that are tied to religious organizations. It's one of the highest profile events that does cater to a different target audience, and the people that were there were very friendly. While I don't think Pride is known as being an event where we can expect a ton of children, there still was a good number there. It is an event that requires a lot of planning and manpower, so I could possibly see it being scaled back next year if it was too much for CANS and tabling, and both being for two days.","At the very end, a mom came up and said how thankful she was for Connections! She's a GSRP mom and said that her navigator checked in throughout the year and was very helpful.","Cyle was a rockstar at planning it. I felt bad that he had a lot of knowledge with CANS to where it felt like I wasn't always super helpful setting up, so I hope that burden can be lessened somehow with just continuing to increase everyone's knowledge on how to set it up. I had read the policies and procedures ahead of time, but ones without pictures were especially challenging, and it also wasn't always clear which materials belonged with which. Also, some of the instructions could use some further editing to increase the clarity. A detailed map of the layout could be helpful.    I think there was a little confusion with the scheduling. I was supposed to leave after set-up, but due to there only being interns scheduled for the next shift, I was needed to lead the table. There were four of us at the table which I think was too many given that we didn't have many activities for kids. This was also early in the day, so maybe more people would have been helpful for later if it got busier. I was available to stay to assist, but just something to consider for next time!    It was super windy, so everything that was brought for the wind was extremely helpful and kept everything down. The water was also very helpful as it was very hot! We were in a great location that was mostly shaded, though.     ",Pink

They were so happy to see me there that afternoon. I gave them a resource folder (left over from our presentation at the GR Neighborhood Summit in May) which contained the resource map divided into specific categories.
